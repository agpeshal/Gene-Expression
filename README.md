## Gene Expression Data Analysis

Analysis of cancer gene expression data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) and [Genome Tissue Expression project](https://gtexportal.org/home/). Pathway activation is studied and interaction between multiple pathways is learned.

Predict if the tissue is [hypoxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)) or not and epithelial to mesenchymal transition ([EMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial%E2%80%93mesenchymal_transition))
